I rolled over and poked my boyfriend in the shoulder, so that he would kiss me or otherwise make a compliment of some important kind. He was pretty bleary-eyed as well, but - luckily for him, cuz otherwise he would have gotten a beating of some very violent kind - he did kiss me and tell me something nice, although I've already forgotten was. I think it was about how sweet I am (he is as discerning person, even in blearyhood.</p><p>\"Guess what I just dreamed about,\" he said.</p><p>\"What?\" I said. I hoped and assumed it was about marrying me, which I imagine is his one true goal in life.</p><p>\"We were planning our wedding -\"</p><p>(Here I chuckled to myself because duh he really has nothing else good to dream about, and I knew it).</p><p>\", but then I got too stressed out with the wedding planning, and decided I didn't want to get married anymore.\" </p><p>The hidden face inside of my real face fell, but my real face stayed smiling and good, ready for more kisses.</p>",

I was hoping for a more dramatic, bar-client to bar-tender kind of deal.</p><p>\"I'm planning on stealing your sandwich,\" he said.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said, now hurrying a little bit on eating my sandwich so that he would have less to steal.</p><p>\"I'm gonna steal a lot of your sandwich,\" he said.</p><p>\"Oh,\" I said. (This interaction was becoming much more agressive than I had anticipated, and now I understood why people are so wary about talking to strangers).</p><p>Then an idea occurred to me:</p><p>\"Hey!\" I said. \"If I give you all my sandwich, then there is no way for you to steal it. It would be gift acceptance and not robbery.\"</p><p>\"Wow,\" the bird said, \"You have really defeated me.\"</p><p>\"Yeah,\" I said. \"Anyway, here is my sandwich. I think you'll like it.\"</p><p>The bird smiled, but just a little too craftily.</p>",
